!side note, i used a scroller/one page format, so projects/potfolios is its own section, rather than page, am working on embed feature to modals to usurp secondary page and, therefor css file for pages. wish me luck. see below.!

this started as a start with bootstrap : freelancer framework.
This is a preliminary portfolio for my coding and design work.
i will address the padding with video.. which looks poorly anyway..
and center alignment for socials at bottom.
additionally looking into embeding gitpages into modals of portfolio via iframe. 
unsure when grading will commense, as cutoff for submission is a few hours away. nit trying to ruin live functional version, but am working to add mentioned functionalluty/display mechanisms locally.
